# What Is Being Done?
Important: adding a couple things. Most of these are already completed, but the last few are not done yet.

The work I plan on doing for the CMS guidebook, as a developer, will be to explain to the user how to:
  1) Choose a theme
  2) Create variations of the current theme to further customize site such as Font, Layout, etc.
  3) Manage Plug-ins and how to appropriatley implement them
  4) Added section 8 to the dropdown menu
  5) Put content into the sections. This is already written, just needs to be linked/coded into the website.
  6) I edited the Section 8 page of the website by making it look aesthetically pleasing. When the content was placed into the      page, spacing, and formatting needed to be done because that didn't translate over from the text. I put in proper spacing, created lists through the coding and all in all made it easily readable.
  7) The glossary section didn't have any formatting as well so I cleaned up the text a little bit. Essentially all I did was coded in the specific word, that was being defined, to be bold. I think it makes it much easier to interpret and separate each word.

# When Is It Being Done?

Sunday December, 8 everything should be implemented. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

Evaluate based on appearance. Does it look professional, and is it easy to navigate? Is it seamless more or less?
Does each section have content? Is there any redundancy. For example, I took out some titles that seemed redundant to be placed more than once. Make sure nothing jumps out at you that probably shouldn't be there. Are the lists easy to read, and are there spaces in between paragraphs. Essentially is it able to be read easily. If so, then that is what I was going for when editing these pages. If all of these things are in working order, then grading is pretty straightforward.

# Who Will Evaluate It?
This is not changing! 
William Jones will be evaluating my work. To my knowledge, I don't think he's in my developer group, so that helps because he won't necessarily be super in tune with how the CMS works on the developer side of things. He's also familiar with a CMS which will allow him to accurately evaluate my work because he should know what works and what doesn't.
