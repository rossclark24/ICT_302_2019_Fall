# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

Going into this semester, I had not even heard of a CMS, let alone how to use one. I did not realize there is actually a whole world of Content Managment Systems. I learned the most during the CMS Guidebook project, mainly by moving through the kinks of allowing people access to publish or edit certain parts of the website. In terms of learning the CMS, I enjoyed the developer side of things. I didn't think the HTML and Markup language was that difficult, however, I liked the idea that you can make it as difficult and complex as you need it to be. My code was very simple.

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I would give myself an 8 on managing workflow. I understand how each major role of a CMS is supposed to work, although I wouldn't rank myself in every position. It is actually a lot more complex of a system than I imagined it to be. 

## I can manage content using established workflows.

Managing content using an established workflow is the most efficient way to run a larger operation. If you have a larger team of people that help compile information, in order to have effiency in any way, you must have some sort of hierarchy/workflow. Without a chain of command, completing a task would be merely impossible. People need specific tasks within a big group, otherwise there is no flow. Once one person is done doing a particular task, they pass it on to the next phase. In terms of a CMS, there really isn't a phase that is more important than the other. A developer is just as important as an administrator, but without either, how does one know what to do? For example, the content creators telling the developers how they want their content implemented is important, but the content creators themselves don't have time to develop all of the coding. Administrators make sure everything is running smooth and allow different people different permissions when needed. These go hand in hand, and without one piece the whole process falls apart.

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I would rate mysef an 8 because I understand the workflow environment. Not just content managment systems, specifically, require a workflow, but just about any job you do. In most corporations there is more of a hierarchy but this is also considered a type of workflow. Efficient workflow goes much deeper than just the scope of this class, however, it was made very simple and apparent within the guidlines of the project.

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

Technology is very important when working with a CMS. The ability to communicate effectively between different designations within the CMS as well as the people in your specific group is key. Without this communication, a seamless workflow will not be possible. To cite a specific example from my experience, I had one of the content creators from the final project and tell me that the idea behind one of their pages was off in terms of implementation. Essentially, the glossary needed to have links to the websites, so with the help of the content creator and her sharing the google documents, I was able to include the requested links. Without this communication, the page would not have been the way it was intended. Another way to understand this concept is that not everyone is going to know another group wants something to be implemented, and effective communication is vital. So, to make the connection to the original question, google docs and Slack helped create the correct page. By communicating through the slack group, and then gaining access to the google docs, I was able to further see how to properly implement the glossary. 

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I would rank myself an 8 in this category. Because of struggling through some of the dilemmas that come without having proper material for the pages, the final product will not be how it was intended. To fully understand how important other sources of technology are for content management, being able to dive into a real world situation simulates how working within a content management system really is.

## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

In order to complete some of the tasks in my CMS guidebook, I had to do a little outside research. While I knew what the final piece was supposed to look like, getting there was a little different. I had to learn a little bit of HTML coding in order to complete some of my tasks. Because I chose the job of being a developer, my role was more back-end side of things. While I wasn't proficient in HTML before, I do know a little bit now and enough to get by. Self-directed learning is something that can't be forced. It is more something that requires an initiative to further develop ideas and knowledge. Another moment to show this was learning journals. Some of the entries were things I came across outside of class and on my own, so choosing to reflect about those instances further confirms the use of resources for self-directed learning.

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

I would give myself an 8 because this is something that I have used throughout the entire semester. Not everything is gained by attending class, and having supplementary information is important, so self-directed learning is vital in the assurance that a task is done completely.

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

Different content management systems are going to enable some aspects more than others. For example Hugo is something that is very simple and has a great platform for small businesses who do not necessarily need anything too complex. It's fairly easy to use and looks professional. WordPress is a little more complicated but has a much larger spectrum of variability. This is more useful for larger corporations who have a much more developed and diverse platform. Although that doesn't mean smaller companies couldn't use WordPress as well, it just means it has a higher ceiling. Comparing and contrasting different systems is important because it allows you to tinker with what works best for the specific needs of the group. We also took a look at many other CMS cites but they didn't provide the services that Hugo and WordPress did. Although that doesn't mean they are bad services, the demographic of these, mostly open source, platforms are all different. One platform might be for advertising, while others might be for website development.

# Final Grade

> Add together your 0-8 ratings to get a final, overall rating between 0-40. Write that number below, and provide an overall summary of why you think this number reflects your performance in this class.

40. I believe I obtained a lot of knowledge out of this class. The CMS Guidebook was a good encapsulator for all the material we went over throughout the entire semester. Really diving into the world of CMS's created a good understanding of how larger corporations work on this level. I think working a lot with the other developers, content creators, and administators produced a nice, although not so smooth at times, product. It gave me real life experience that I can now use for a good foundation and basis throughout the rest of my career. I think I carried out my role as a developer too in terms of the final project. It was fun coordinating with the class and reaching a common goal.
