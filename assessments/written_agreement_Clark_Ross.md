# What Is Being Done?

The work I plan on doing for the CMS guidebook, as a developer, will be to explain to the user how to:
  1) Choose a theme
  2) Create variations of the current theme to further customize site such as Font, Layout, etc.
  3) Manage Plug-ins and how to appropriatley implement them

# When Is It Being Done?

I will begin the process of creating an outline of these specific things starting Monday October 21, 2019. I expect it to take about a couple weeks to finish because the Plug-ins part of the guidebook will require qutie a bit of work. The first two parts shouldn't take but a couple days to complete each.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

Use the standard of someone who doens't necesarily know the developer side to a CMS or someone who hasn't particularly worked with a CMS. The idea behind my Guidbook is to help someone who has had little to no experience with a CMS. If it is accurate and easily followed, that should be a cinsistent standard to base your thoughts on.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

William Jones will be evaluating my work. To my knowledge, I don't think he's in my developer group, so that helps because he won't necessarily be super in tune with how the CMS works on the developer side of things. He's also familiar with a CMS which will allow him to accurately evaluate my work because he should know what works and what doesn't.
