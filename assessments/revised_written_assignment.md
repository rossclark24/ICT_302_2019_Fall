# What Is Being Done?
Important: adding a couple things. Most of these are already completed, but the last few are not done yet.

The work I plan on doing for the CMS guidebook, as a developer, will be to explain to the user how to:
  1) Choose a theme
  2) Create variations of the current theme to further customize site such as Font, Layout, etc.
  3) Manage Plug-ins and how to appropriatley implement them
  4) Added section 8 to the dropdown menu
  5) Put content into the sections. This is already written, just needs to be linked/coded into the website.

# When Is It Being Done?

Sunday December, 8 everything should be implemented. 

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

Evaluate based on appearance. Does it look professional, and is it easy to navigate? Is it seamless more or less?
Does each section have content?
If all of these things are in working order, then grading is pretty straightforward.

# Who Will Evaluate It?
This is not changing! 
William Jones will be evaluating my work. To my knowledge, I don't think he's in my developer group, so that helps because he won't necessarily be super in tune with how the CMS works on the developer side of things. He's also familiar with a CMS which will allow him to accurately evaluate my work because he should know what works and what doesn't.
