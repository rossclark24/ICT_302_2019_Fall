# Similarities

> Hugo, Word Press, and Drupal are each popular Content Management Systems. Each come with a few different nuances, but at the core they are very similar. Hugo is a smaller platform, however it does come with a lot of benefits. For example Hugo covers wide range of users because it is cross-platform design. Word Press and Drupal also are cross-platform and contain nice functionality with different themes and allows for seamless structure and behind-the-scenes modifications. An example of this would be editing posts.

# Differences

> While each of these are in fact CMS' they do have their differences. In my opinion, Hugo doesn't have the versatility the other two do. Hugo has a nice "blanket" structure, but editing and really getting deep into the code doesn't have a lot of variability. I believe Word Press has the best CMS between the three because it is a little bit more user friendly. I found Drupal to be a little complicated and tough to find how things are structured. Drupal is better equipped to be used with larger websites that have the luxury of having more people on their CMS team. Smaller websites with fewer people would be better suited for Word Press in my opinion because it's easier to use and you still have a lot of versatility to make the website your own.
